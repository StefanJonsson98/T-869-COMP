Processing time for one image:
    Catcing steadily -30 frames in one second; 1/30.

Changed processing time:
    Processing time doesn´t really change when the brightness detection is added.

The processing time is identical without the image being displayed.

My double for-loop is marginally worse than the built-in function, speed wise. 

I'd guess about 10-20ms.

I don't know. IVcam wasn´t compatible with my system. It would heavily depend on the server.
